                  A game of JOKGU is played between two teams comprised of four
                  players each. The purpose is to use only the lower legs (below
                  the knees) and the head (above the chin) to get the ball over
                  the net and ground it on the other team’s court to score a
                  point or to prevent the other team from scoring.

                  was directed from the other team (incl. a serve) is redirected
                  to the other side of the court before it touches the ground on
                  one’s own side of the court (incl. blocking).

                <p>
                  If a player engages in an act that lacks sportsmanship in
                  order to prevent the other team from scoring two points,
                  he/she will be given a warning, and the other team will be
                  awarded two points.

                  The ball is considered to be in play if it touches any part of

                  Each game consists of three sets, in principle, provided that
                  the number of sets may be increased or decreased by the head
                  of the competition in consideration of the overall
                  circumstances.

                <p>
                  The minimum score to win a set is 15 points. In case of a
                  deuce, the team that scores two points first wins. The maximum
                  score that can be obtained is 19 points. In the final set, the
                  teams will switch courts after one of them scores 8 points.
                  The teams may switch courts once beyond the score of 8 points
                  whenever such is made aware.

                  Points can be scored irrespective of whether the team is

                <p>
                  Timeouts must be requested by the head coach and approved by
                  the main referee. One timeout is allowed per set, and it must
                  last no longer than one minute.

                  Player substitution must be requested by the head coach, and
                  it should be approved based on the following criteria:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    1. Each team is allowed to freely substitute up to three
                    players per set among the players on the players’ list.
                    However, when the captain is substituted out, the captain
                    band must be handed over to one of the players on the court.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    2. Player changes at the start of a set are not viewed as
                    substitutions. However, it must be notified to the main
                    referee because otherwise, it will be viewed as a
                    substitution.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3. In the event of an injury during the game, two breaks for
                    up to 3 minutes each time may be granted for each team per
                    game. If all four players are not on the court after the 3
                    minutes, the team in question will be disqualified.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    4. Substitution must be finished within 5 seconds after it
                    is authorized by the main referee. If there are delays, the
                    team will be cautioned.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    5. Under no circumstances can there be a player substitution
                    in the absence of the head coach.

                  Only the lower legs below the knees and the head above the
                  chin can come in contact with the ball.

                <p>
                  Court plays can be made freely for up to 3 bounces off the
                  ground and 3 bodily touches. A serve or an attack can be
                  blocked (body parts that can come into contact with the ball
                  in this case are the same as those outlined in Paragraph 9),
                  and the team playing offense has the right to play the ball
                  that is located above the net after a bounce (the team playing
                  defense will lose a point to the other team if they touch the
                  ball).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ball should only be allowed to touch the ground once in
                  between plays and be touched once by a player for up to three
                  touches while it is in the court (33 principle). The rules may
                  be changed by the executive board of the competition in case
                  of an event competition that is broadcast on television, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Net play is permitted, and all situations occurring at the
                  net, except physical contact, are considered an in-play. The
                  net boundary, however, is marked by the antennae, outside
                  which is not considered part of the net.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the ball or a part of the body penetrates below the net,
                  the other team will be awarded a point, regardless of whether
                  it interfered with the defense of the other team. If a part of
                  a player’s body enters the opponent’s court and interferes
                  with their defense, a point will be awarded to the other team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A ball that is in midair is in play and alive until it hits
                  the ground or another object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Questions regarding the rules applied in the game can only be
                  asked to the main referee by the captain. An appeal can be
                  filed to the table officials by the head coach by describing
                  the circumstances based on the principles of 5 W’s and 1 H.
                  The case will be judged by the Fair Sports Committee and the
                  referee, players, executive board, etc. involved will be
                  strictly penalized or rewarded (municipal/provincial
                  association(s) and individuals concerned will be notified and
                  the information will be posted on the website).
                </p>
                <p>
                  No count (e.g. points not counted, or game cancellation) will
                  be applied in the event of a natural disaster, or in case an
                  obstacle enters into the court in the middle of the game and
                  comes into contact with the ball, or it is deemed impossible
                  to continue the game, or both teams have violated the game
                  rules simultaneously, or it is impossible to make a proper
                  judgment, or when the game did not proceed properly due to
                  faulty facilities or equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when the ball passes through outside the antenna, if a
                  player puts it back into the court from outside the antenna on
                  the outside, before it bounces off the ground, and the ball is
                  returned inside the antenna within a valid number of touches,
                  it will be deemed that the ball is still in play.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A decision based on an agreement may be requested by the
                  captain of either team. If there is a justifiable protest or
                  it is difficult for the main referee to make a decision on
                  his/her own, the main and assistant referees should make a
                  decision based on an agreement. Such decisions are final, and
                  a decision based on an agreement is only permitted once per
                  set.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A final decision (decision based on an agreement) made by the
                  main referee cannot be overturned. However, before a final
                  decision (e.g. decision based on an agreement) is made, the
                  game may be stopped if it is difficult to make an accurate
                  decision, and the main and assistant referees should consult
                  each other to make a final decision based on an agreement. (If
                  a wrong decision is made without going through this procedure
                  and it is acknowledged by the referee in question, the referee
                  will be subject to disciplinary action, and appeal will not be
                  accepted.) A decision based on an agreement between the main
                  and assistant referees will only be made in the event of an
                  uncertain decision or wrorng decision, and agreement needs not
                  be made for every issue.

                  A request for a video replay to check for a bad call by a
                  referee during a competition that is being broadcast may be
                  made by the head coach, once per game. The head coach should
                  file an appeal with the main referee before a decision based
                  on an agreement is made and request it to the table officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game may be stopped if necessary based on the judgment of
                  the main referee.

                  where more than half the area of the court is not in a
                  condition that allows the ball to bounce off.

                    be decided by a meeting of representatives.

                  A person who serves before the signal or delaying the serve

                  After a signal is given by the main referee to begin the

                <p>
                  A serve consists of the ball leaving the ball and coming into
                  contact with the part of the body allowed contact before it
                  bounces off the ground. It is finished as soon as it bounces

                </p>
                <p>
                  The ball must be served within 5 seconds after a signal is

                  When a player touches the net inside the antennae with any
                  part of his/her body or anything attached to his/her body,
                  regardless of whether he/she is playing offense or defense,
                  his/her team will lose a point, and this will also be the case
                  when anything he/she was wearing comes off and touches the net
                  inside the antennae.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Double touch, which means to touch the ball twice or dribble
                  the ball, will result in the other team being awarded a point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Going over time means failing to direct the ball to the other
                  team’s court after three touches, and it will result in the
                  other team being awarded a point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Holding refers to a situation where the ball stays on a
                  player’s body in the form of lifting, pressing, adhering, or
                  pushing, and it will result in the other team being awarded a
                  point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over-the-net means that a part of the body or anything
                  attached to the body goes over the net and it will result in
                  the other team being awarded a point, regardless of the
                  whether the player was playing offense or defense. This is
                  also the case when anything he/she was wearing comes off and
                  goes over the net. However, when it comes to the ball, if it
                  is touched before it completely goes over the net, it will be
                  considered to be in play.
                </p>
                <span></span>
                <p>
                  When it comes to touching the ball with the body, a point will
                  be awarded to the other team if one does not touch the ball
                  with a part of the body that is permitted (head above the
                  chin, lower legs below the knees).
                </p>

                <p>
                  A touch-out refers to the ball bouncing out of the court after
                  it is touched by a defensive player, and in this case, a point
                  will be awarded to the offensive team. When the ball comes
                  into contact with the ground and the body of a defensive
                  player outside the court at the same time, a point will be
                  awarded to the offensive team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An out means that the ball goes out of the court after it is
                  touched by the team playing offense, or it is bounced out of
                  the court on the defensive team’s side, or the ball passes
                  below the net, or the ball passes outside the antenna after
                  three touches, and in such cases, a point will be awarded to
                  the other team.
                </p>
                <span></span>
                <p>
                  If the ball passes through the area outside the antenna after
                  it is touched by the team playing defense and bounces off the
                  other team’s court, or a player enters the other team’s court,
                  a point will be awarded to the other team. A point will be
                  awarded to the other team if a player or the ball touches one
                  of the antennae. If the ball that passes outside the antenna
                  is touched by a player on the other team, or if a player
                  interferes with a defensive action, a point will be awarded to
                  the other team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the ball touches another object midair, the team who played
                  the ball immediately before it (by touching or bouncing) will
                  lose a point to the other team.
